# Time-based Access Control

## Project Description
Time-based Access Control is a smart contract that allows an admin to grant and revoke access to users for a limited duration. It's ideal for applications requiring temporary permissions, such as subscriptions, trial access, or limited resource exposure.

## Project Vision
The goal is to provide a secure, decentralized way to manage time-restricted access to blockchain-based services without relying on centralized databases or servers.

## Key Features
- Admin-only control for access management.
- Time-limited access granted via Ethereum addresses.
- Ability to revoke access at any time.
- Public function to verify access status.
- Protected function requiring valid access.

## Future Scope
- Add support for NFT-based access passes.
- Integrate subscription models using ERC-20 tokens.
- Multi-admin support with role-based control.
- Off-chain notifications for access expiry.
